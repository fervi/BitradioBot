The BitradioBot project is a bot that is used to make money using the Bitrad.io cryptocurrency. His task is to recognize what is happening on the screen and react to it.

To run a basic bot, we need:
* Web browser: Firefox / Chrome (or based on them)
* Anti-captcha plugin
* Bitradio wallet with address
* Scar Divi

How to run?

The code should be rewritten, because it was used to run 8 instances of bitradio. However, we load the script to scar divi, run and go for coffee.
