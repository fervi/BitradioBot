The BitradioBot project is a bot that is used to make money using the Bitrad.io cryptocurrency. His task is to recognize what is happening on the screen and react to it.

To run a basic bot, we need:
* Web browser: Firefox / Chrome (or based on them)
* Anti-captcha plugin
* Bitradio wallet with address
* Scar Divi

How to run?

If you need only one instance of bot running, use bitradio.scar.

If you need eight instances, use bitradio8.scar.

If you need lower / higher instance you need to:
* modify xwin value in bitradio8.scar (xwin is distance between two icons in start menu bar)
* change in 73 line condition to browser instances - 1 (so for 8 - i=7)
